# Handling LiDAR data through existing software solutions (Tutorial)

This tutorial is focusing on to get an overview how to derive additional attributes for LiDAR data using already existed software solutions which can be input for for further segmentation/classification tasks within e-EcoLiDAR project.


# Installation requirements
- [FugroViewer](https://www.fugro.com/about-fugro/our-expertise/technology/fugroviewer) 
- [Cloud Compare](http://www.cloudcompare.org/) 
- [OPALS](http://geo.tuwien.ac.at/opals/html/usr_install.html) – you should register on the download page and download opals_2.2.0_win64.exe and opals_2.2.0._win_PythonAddons.exe. After you downloaded it you should extract into a directory (firstly run the *win64.exe than *PythonAddons.exe). 
If you get the error message “If the Redistributable Packages for Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, 2010 and/or 2015 have not already been installed on your machine, then it is necessary to install them by runnning"  you should run the exe files within [path name of the directory where you extracted your opals]\addons\vcredist 2008, 2010, 2015 directories.
- [LAStools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/) – you should download and extract it into a directory
- [QGIS (with GRASS GIS)](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
- [Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)  – current tutorial not dealing with introducing LiDAR data handling within python because currently Chris Lucas tutorial is available for that purpose [here](https://github.com/clucas111/delineating-linear-elements/blob/master/Thesis/Appendices.pdf)
